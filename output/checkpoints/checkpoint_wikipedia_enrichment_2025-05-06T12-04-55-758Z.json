Prior to becoming president, he served as the first elected deputy president of Kenya from 2013 to 2022.[1][2][3][4] He previously served in three cabinet portfolios as the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister of Agriculture and as Minister for Higher Education.",
          "Ruto was elected Member of Parliament for Eldoret North constituency from 1997 to 2007 under the KANU, and from 2007 to 2013 through the ODM party. He was the Minister for Home Affairs in the Daniel arap Moi administration from August to December 2002.",
          "He was later nominated to run for the deputy presidency in the 2013 election under the United Republican Party, becoming the running mate of Uhuru Kenyatta from The National Alliance (TNA). He was re-elected to the deputy presidency under the Jubilee Party in the 2017 Kenyan general election. Ruto successfully ran for the presidency in the 2022 election, this time under the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).",
          "During his time in the campus for his undergraduate education, Ruto was an active member of the Christian Union. He also served as the Chairman of the University of Nairobi's choir.[16] Through his church activities at the University of Nairobi, he met President Daniel arap Moi, who would later introduce him to politics during the 1992 general elections.[17]",
          "Ruto ran for a parliamentary seat in the 1997 general election. He surprisingly beat the incumbent, Reuben Chesire, Moi's preferred candidate, as well as the Uasin Gishu KANU branch chairman and assistant minister.[21][22] He later gained favour with Moi and was appointed KANU Director of Elections.[23] His strong support in 2002 for Moi's preferred successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, saw him get a place as assistant minister in the Home Affairs (Interior) ministry. Later in that election, when some government ministers resigned to join the opposition, he was promoted to full Cabinet Minister.[19] KANU lost the election but he retained his parliamentary seat. Ruto was elected KANU Secretary General in 2005, with Uhuru Kenyatta elected as chairman.[23]",
          "On 21 April 2010, Ruto was transferred from the Agriculture Ministry and posted to the Higher Education Ministry, swapping posts with Sally Kosgei.[35] On 24 August 2011, Ruto was relieved of his ministerial duties but remained a member of parliament. He joined with Uhuru Kenyatta to form the Jubilee alliance for the 2013 presidential election.[36]",
          "On 6 October 2014, Ruto was appointed acting president of Kenya by the then President Uhuru Kenyatta following his summons to appear before the ICC. He served in the role between 6 and 9 October 2014 while President Kenyatta was away at The Hague. When he officially handed over power to Ruto at the Parliament on October 6, Uhuru explained, \"To protect the sovereignty of the Republic of Kenya, I will sign a legal notice appointing Hon William Ruto as acting president while I attend the status conference.\"[37]",
          "In the August 2017 General Elections, Uhuru and Ruto were declared victors after garnering 54% of the total votes cast. However, the Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the election, and a fresh election was held in October 2017. The opposition boycotted the fresh election and Uhuru and Ruto were re-elected with 98% of the total votes cast. The Supreme Court upheld the results of this second election.[38]",
          "Two days later, on 21 September 2022, President Ruto made his debut address as head of state to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York. He nodded to President Biden's \"Build Back Better\" domestic plan, proposing a global effort toward \"building back better from the bottom upward.\" The goal, he said, should be \"including the marginalized, working majority in the economic mainstream.\" Other themes he addressed were the expansion of the representation of Africa on the U.N. Security Council,[53] increased investment in the African continent, \"moving Africa from aid to investment\", tapping \"the ever-bustling\" human capital for economic prosperity and a concerted effort towards tackling climate change in the world.[54]"

          "Ruto started his education at Kamagut Primary School, then transferred to Kerotet Primary School—both situated within the Uasin Gishu County; and he sat for his Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) at the latter. He then proceeded to Wareng Secondary School, still in Uasin Gishu County, and later Kapsabet High School in Nandi County, where he obtained his Ordinary Level and Advanced Level education respectively.[11]\n",
          "He then enrolled at the University of Nairobi to pursue Botany and Zoology, graduating in 1990 with a BSc.[12] He went on to complete an MSc in Plant Ecology, also from the University of Nairobi.[13] The year after his graduation, he enrolled for a Ph.D. at the same university, and after several setbacks,[14] he completed and graduated on 21 December 2018. \n",

He also served as the Chairman of the University of Nairobi's choir.[16] Through his church activities at the University of Nairobi, he met President Daniel arap Moi, who would later introduce him to politics during the 1992 general elections.[17]\n",
          "Ruto has been widely and repeatedly linked to the assassination of Jacob Juma by several media, activists, politicians, opposition figures in Kenya, including Jacob Juma himself.[77][78] Jacob Juma was a wealthy businessman[79] who became a fierce government critic and anti-corruption crusader who became known for posting targeted cryptic tweets against Ruto and the Jubilee government months before he was assassinated in Nairobi.[80][81][82] In December 2015, Jacob Juma, in his tweets, claimed Ruto was obsessed with killing him.[78][83] In May 2016, Jacob Juma was shot dead along Ngong Road.[84] In the same month, during the burial of Jacob Juma, a former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo and previously a close ally of Ruto claimed Jacob Juma had physically assaulted Ruto by slapping him for having a sour relationship over unspecified reasons.[85] Jirongo urged police to investigate the assassination based on the assault.[86] Later in the month, Ruto threatened to sue Jirongo for linking him to the assassination.[87][88] Jirongo claimed that he and another former minister, Chris Okemo, were personally involved in paying the murdered government critic university's tuition fees, and that he knew the matter surrounding the controversy all too well.[85] According to Jirongo, the same assassins were involved in the murder of Meshack Yebei, another murdered prospective defence witness in the ICC trial against Ruto.[85]\n",
          "In June 2016, the Canadian newspaper Financial Post and the Kenyan newspaper The Standard both reported that Jacob Juma was the director of a Canadian company (Pacific Wildcat) whose license to explore $2 billion worth of minerals in Kwale county in Kenya was cancelled just after the Jubilee government took over.[89][90] This cancellation led Jacob Juma to call a press conference where he claimed that the then Mining Minister Najib Balala was demanding a bribe to have the cancelled license re-issued to the company. This cancellation led Jacob Juma into personal financial ruin, and it was reported he was routinely borrowing money. He became a fierce government critic after he felt short-changed out of the mining license that eventually caused his company to lose money.[91] According to a different company official of the same Canadian company, Ruto and Balala demanded transfer of the mining company's license to a new company with the Kenyan government to receive a 50% stake in the new company for free.[89][90] This eventually led Jacob Juma to become fiercely critical of Ruto and the Jubilee government in tweets, media interviews, court filings, and political correspondence with opposition figures as well as diplomatic missions in Kenya.[81][92] It later emerged Jacob Juma had promised the board of the Canadian company Pacific Wildcat that he would fight bureaucratic delays as well as the corruption that would stand in the way of getting the mining license. A high court ruling in Kenya found that the Mining minister was right to cancel the license of the Canadian company.[93]\n"

          "In November 2012, Maalim led a group of MPs, which accused Kenyan soldiers of fomenting violence and using undue force during a security operation in Garissa. The legislators threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if the perpetrators were not brought to justice.[7][8] Maalim also claimed that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval,[7] and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2billion in missed revenue.[8]",
          "In the 2022 elections, Maalim was elected Wiper MP for Dadaab with a landslide win against Abdikheir Abdullahi Dubow who was backed by then the immediate MP Hon. Mohamed Dahir Duale.[9]",
          "The backlash was immediate and intense; Maalim was summoned[11] by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) to explain his statements, which were seen as inciting violence and discrimination. He defended himself by claiming the video was edited and manipulated to misrepresent his words, suggesting that political opponents from Somalia might have been behind the alteration. Despite this defense, the NCIC pursued the investigation,[12] indicating the severity with which his comments were taken.",
          "Maalim's remarks also led to professional repercussions. He was expelled[13] from the Wiper Democratic Movement-Kenya, where he served as the Deputy Party Leader, due to his failure to uphold the party's ideals following his controversial statements. This expulsion was accompanied by a call from the party's National Executive Council for his removal from all parliamentary leadership roles, including his position on the Speaker's panel.",
          "The outrage following Maalim's comments was swift and widespread on social media, with many Kenyans condemning his choice of words as unbecoming of a parliamentarian. The youth, who have been actively engaging in political discourse and demanding accountability, felt particularly insulted by the remarks, seeing them as an attack not only on their activism but also on their families' honor.",
          "This incident has highlighted the significant divide between Maalim and the younger generation, drawing criticism from various quarters, including civil society groups and political analysts, who argue that such language is counterproductive to fostering a healthy political dialogue. Calls for Maalim to apologize have been loud, with some suggesting that his remarks warrant disciplinary action from his party or parliamentary ethics committee."

He held eight senior civil servant and ministerial positions that included Minister of State (1979–82), Minister of Energy (1963), Minister of East African and Regional Co-operation (1998–99) and Minister of Regional Development, Science, and Technology (1982).[1]\n\nBiwott was widely regarded as one of the most powerful and competent ministers of president Moi's government. He was also at the forefront of efforts to deepen regional cooperation. Former president Uhuru Kenyatta eulogised Biwott as a \"patriot and diligent leader, who spent decades building schools and hospitals and spearheading every other kind of development including marketing Kenya abroad\".[2]",

          "Biwott was a member of parliament for 28 years. In 1974, he ran unsuccessfully as a prospective MP for the Keiyo South Constituency. At the next election (1979), he was successful, standing on KANU ticket in Keiyo-Marakwet, retaining the seat in 1983 and 1988. In 1992, 1997, and 2002 he was elected the MP for Keiyo South Constituency. In the Parliamentary elections held on 27 December 2007, running on a KANU ticket, he lost his seat to Jackson Kiptanui Arap Kamai of the Orange Democratic Party (ODM). The ODM swept to victory in all but one of KANU's seats on the Rift Valley.",
          "Following the 2002 election, Biwott served on the Devolution Committee of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission. Biwott was the only Member of Parliament who abstained on the Constitutional Referendum held in 2005, stating that the Draft Constitution 'would divide the country along ethnic lines'. The draft Constitution was rejected at the Referendum.",
          "In 1974, Biwott stood as a candidate for the Keiyo South constituency in the general election of that year but was narrowly defeated.",
          "Following the election of 1979 (in which he was elected Member of Parliament for 1979 Keiyo South election, a seat he retained until December 2007), Nicholas Biwott returned to the Office of the President but now promoted to Minister of State (1979–82) with responsibility for science and technology, cabinet affairs, land settlement, and immigration.",
          "Although he remained a member of parliament, Biwott held no position in the Government of Kenya from 1991 until he re-entered government as Minister of State in the Office of the President of East Africa in 1997 before, in January 1998, he established and was appointed Minister of the new Ministry of East African and Regional Co-operation (1998–99).",
          "In May 2001, (following a further reorganisation of Ministry responsibilities) Nicholas Biwott continued as the Minister of Trade and Industry and East African Tourism (2001–02). Over the next eighteen months he established the Small Medium Trade Trust Fund with the European Union, introduced an Intellectual Property bill which was passed as an Act, accomplished a free trade area with COMESA, established the Africa Trade Insurance Agency[9] to cover foreign investments against political risk, and served as Chairman of the African Caribbean Pacific Group (ACP) at the World Trade Organization.",
          "In December 2003, Biwott issued a formal complaint against New Scotland Yard through his lawyer on the basis that Troon's investigation was 'fundamentally flawed and, in many cases erroneous' and called on New Scotland Yard 'to investigate Troon and to issue an apology. The request was ultimately turned down in December 2004 by the Metropolitan Police as the original investigation 'did not involve a citizen of the United Kingdom, potential suspect, or even witnesses', and because 'the resources of the Metropolitan Police are limited'. Another reason given for the refusal by the Metropolitan Police to review the case was that the Kenyan Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) was investigating the death of Dr Robert Ouko and that it was 'open to Mr Biwott to make any representations he wishes to that Inquiry'.",
          "Parliament in 2005 refused to consider Sungu’s report. It was tabled again on December 8, 2010, but was rejected by Members of parliament for being “shoddy” and for having been used “to settle political scores”."

          "Biwott entered government service in 1965 as the District Officer, in South Imenti and Tharaka, Meru District (January 1965–66). As District Officer Biwott instituted, on a 'harambee' basis, community fundraising programmes to aid the development of local irrigation projects and roads, to build a health centre at Nkwene and schools at Nkubu and Kanyakine, develop employment at the Igoji quarries and promote the planting of coffee and tea. He was also actively involved in the resettlement of previously European owned land through the 'Land Transfer' programme, part of the 'Million Acres' scheme, and played a central role in the rehabilitation of the Mau Mau, many of whom still remained in the Mau Forest four years after the end of the 'Emergency', helping to persuade them to give up violence and organising the resettlement of many on to their own land.[citation needed]\n",
          "Having completed his master's degree in Australia in 1968, Nicholas Biwott returned to public service in the Ministry of Agriculture, GOK, Personal Assistant to Minister Bruce MacKenzie (1968–70). He coordinated cereal production, the marketing of cereal crops and the management of the Ministry's fertiliser policy, and helped develop research into new strains of wheat and maize more suited to the growing conditions in Kenya. He played a similar co-ordinating role for the Ministry's work with the East African Council of Ministers (MacKenzie was also a member of the council), guiding Kenya's policy in the region in the development of ports, railways and the East African Airways.\n",
          "Mr Biwott supported a number of projects in the areas of education, health and medicine, and assisting small businesses. In 2008, he established the Mbegu Trust 'to develop education and opportunity in Kenya'.[10]\n",
          "Nicholas Biwott took a personal and active role in the development of education in Kenya, particularly the education of girls, through the building of numerous schools. These included the Maria Soti Educational Centre a model school for girls from all backgrounds built as a tribute to his mother, as well as the Biwott Secondary School.\n",
          "Biwott also played an active role in raising funds for the building of many other colleges and educational projects, and was the founder and patron of the Keiyo South Education Foundation that provides bursaries to needy students for primary and secondary education.\n"

          "Kenyatta was re-elected for a second and final term in the August 2017 general elections, winning 54% of the popular vote.[5][6] The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati.[7][8] However, Uhuru's election was challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling.[9] A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39.03% electoral voter participation.",
          "Subsequently, Uhuru Kenyatta was Minister of Finance from 2009 to 2012, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. Accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of committing crimes against humanity in relation to the violent aftermath of the 2007 election, he resigned as Minister of Finance on 26 January 2012.[17] He was elected as President of Kenya in the March 2013 presidential election, defeating Raila Odinga with a slim majority in a single round of voting.",
          "In the 1997 general election, Uhuru Kenyatta contested for the Gatundu South Constituency parliamentary seat, once held by his father, but lost to Moses Mwihia, a Nairobi architect.[18]",
          "In 1999, Moi appointed Uhuru to chair the Kenya Tourism Board, a government parastatal. In 2001, he was nominated as a Member of Parliament, and joined the Cabinet as Minister for Local Government.[19] He would also later be elected First Vice Chairman of KANU.[19]",
          "After Kibaki and Odinga reached a power-sharing agreement, Kenyatta was named Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade on 13 April 2008, as part of the Grand Coalition Cabinet. He was the Deputy Prime Minister representing the PNU, while another Deputy Prime Minister, Musalia Mudavadi, represented the ODM.[38][39][40]",
          "In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was elected as the 4th President of Kenya under The National Alliance (TNA), which was part of the Jubilee Alliance with his running mate William Ruto's United Republican Party (URP).[44] Uhuru and Ruto won 50.07% of votes cast, with closest rivals, Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy garnering 42%.[45]",
          "On 8 October 2014, Kenyatta appeared before the ICC in The Hague. He was called to appear at the ICC \"status conference\" when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld. In a speech to the Kenyan parliament Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity — not as president of the country — so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans. Kenyatta did not speak in court, but denied the charges in comments to journalists as he left the court to catch a flight back home. \"We as Kenyans, we know where we came from, we know where we are going, and nobody will tell us what to do,\" he said. The judges adjourned the hearings and charges were dropped on 13 March 2015.[64][65][66]",
          "On 17 September 2012, The National Alliance party had its first real test when it contested various civic and parliamentary positions in a by-election that covered 17 seats in total; 3 parliamentary and 14 civic. Overall, 133,054 votes were cast in the by-elections and TNA led the pack after it garnered 38.89% or 51,878 votes, followed by Orange Democratic Movement with 33.7% or 44,837 votes, Party of National Unity with 4.46% or 5,929 votes, Wiper Democratic Movement with 4.44% or 5,912 votes and United Democratic Forum with 4.15% or 5,520 votes.",
          "TNA won civic and parliamentary seats in 7 different counties while its closest challengers, ODM won seats in 4 counties.[68]\nThe National Alliance Party remained a strong contender for the following year's general elections, having received major defections from other big political parties of Kenya. The successful election of TNA's main candidates (Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto) continued to enhance TNA's viability.",
          "Further, an exit poll conducted by UCSD Professor Clark Gibson and James Long, Asst. Prof. and University of Washington suggested that neither Odinga nor Kenyatta had attained the 50% plus one vote threshold.[79] Analysts[who?] have contended that even though elections for five other levels were held in Kenya at the same time, their national turnout levels and total vote tallies were about 16% less than the presidential total; e.g. while 10.6 million voters elected candidates for member of the National Assembly, the Senate and the 47 gubernatorial seats, almost 2 million more voted in the presidential election. This has fueled concern and speculations of vote manipulation in President Kenyatta's favor.[80]",
          "Two groups disputed these results and filed petitions challenging various aspects of it at the Supreme Court of Kenya to contest the result. The groups were the Coalition For Reform and Democracy, CORD, led by Raila Odinga, and the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AFRICOG). Uhuru Kenyatta and his running mate were respondents in these cases and were represented by Fred Ngatia and Katwa Kigen respectively.[81]",
          "On 28 June 2018, Kenyatta declared a major crackdown on corruption and stated that no one was immune from corruption charges in Kenya.[104] Kenyatta also stated his own brother Muhoho, a director in a company that had been accused in parliament of importing contraband sugar, should be charged if there is clear evidence against him.[105]",
          "As the President, Kenyatta'a foreign relations were dominated by the ICC question.[120] His relations with the West were expected to be cold, more so after the West warned Kenyans not to elect him as president.[121] The United Kingdom promised to have only essential contacts with him if he were elected.[122] However, his relationship with the West thawed significantly and he participated in the US — Africa summit[123] as well as a Somalia summit in the United Kingdom.[124] The ICC accused his government of frustrating its investigation efforts into the case,[125] although it absolved the President personally of any involvement in the frustration.[126]"

          "Mwaura served as a senior adviser to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga from 2010 to 2012 on Public Policy on Special Interest Groups.[7][8]",
          "Mwaura was an activist as early as a freshman at Kenyatta University when he organised a strike against a Non-governmental organisation that was exploiting visually impaired students at the university. Subsequently, he and others successfully lobbied the Joint Admission Board of Kenya to admit students with special needs who had met the minimum required grade for university placement. While still a freshman at Kenyatta University, Mwaura was elected as a student leader and joined hands with other leaders including the current Homa Bay Women Representative Gladys Wanga to oust the then Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani out of office for he was serving an illegal term. During his tenure as a student leader, Mwaura is credited for coordinating the review of students' union constitution, transforming it from an archaic one to a more vibrant and inclusive document.[24]",
          "In 2006, Mwaura and other persons with albinism in Kenya founded Albinism Society of Kenya[usurped] (ASK), a national organisation that brings together persons with albinism in Kenya and whose mission is to create awareness on the rights of persons with albinism, their social inclusion, empowerment and equity to socio-economic opportunities. Mwaura articulated the objective of ASK: \"We wanted to share and celebrate our differences and uniqueness as persons with albinism and lobby the government to fund the national development fund for persons with albinism.\"[25] Mwaura is the National Coordinator and the Chairman of Albinism Society of Kenya, and through his stewardship, the organisation has made significant milestones in rescuing persons with albinism from ritual killings as well as creating job opportunities and economic empowerment for persons with albinism in Kenya. Additionally, the organisation has been involved in policy and legislative advocacy, albinism awareness, eye-care and sunscreen programme, education support, counselling programme and cancer treatment intervention for persons with albinism .[26] Through ASK, persons with albinism in Kenya are provided with free sunscreen lotions, prescription glasses and protective clothing in order to shield them from harmful solar radiation. Also to note, more than 30 hospitals in Kenya have been equipped with cryotherapy equipment in order to assist in mitigation of skin cancer, and a special fund has been set aside to meet medical expenses of skin patients with cancer with albinism. Other key achievements ASK is proud of is the appointment of Mumbi Ngugi, a woman with albinism, as the Judge of High Court in Kenya[27] and emergence of Goldalyn Kakuya, a girl with albinism, as the best student in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in Kenya in 2017 after scoring 455 marks out of 500.[28] Mwaura has mentored young persons with albinism, including Martin Pepela Wanyonyi, an elected Member of County Assembly (MCA) for Ndivisi Ward in Bungoma county, and Timothy Aseke who is a nominated MCA in Kakamega county.[29][30]",
          "At parliament level where he is a Senator, Mwaura has successfully championed for the increase in budget allocation to National Council for Persons with Disabilities, as well as inclusion of youth with disabilities to the National Youth Service. Besides advocating for persons with disabilities to be appointed to various constitutional commissions and government agencies, Mwaura has ensured an establishment of an isolated budget to cater for free sunscreen lotions[37] skin cancer treatment and eye-care services for persons with albinism.[38] Mwaura is the pioneer and the founding chair of Kenya Disability Parliamentary Association (KEDIPA), a caucus of Members of Parliament with disabilities in Kenya.[39] Furthermore, Mwaura in 2018 petitioned Central Bank of Kenya to ensure the new currency is accessible to persons with visual impairments, which was adopted and implemented.[40] Also, Mwaura successfully lobbied and pushed amendments to the law to have persons with albinism captured in the 2019 Census in Kenya as well as enumeration of intersex persons.[41]",
          "In 2016, Mwaura was honoured with the First Class: Chief of the Burning Spear (CBS) by Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta for his immense disability advocacy and parliamentary achievement.[42] Similarly, in 2019, Mwaura was feted during the United Nation's 40th Human Rights Council Convention in Geneva, Switzerland for his efforts in fighting for the rights of persons with albinism in Kenya.[43]",
          "In addition, political representation, including nomination of Mwaura as a Senator representing Persons with Disabilities in the Parliament has offered persons with albinism an enormous leverage to vouch for a distinct identity in law and in the society.[56]",
          "Mwaura's political career commenced in Kenyatta University where he was elected as a student leader in 2002 when he was a freshman. Through this position, he joined hands with other elected student leaders and lecturers to lobby the President Mwai Kibaki's Narc government to grant amnesty and readmit university students who had been expelled during the President Daniel arap Moi's regime. Subsequently, he and other leaders organised a major strike that ousted the Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani who was serving an illegal term at Kenyatta University.",
          "After completing his undergraduate course at Kenyatta University, Mwaura joined Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party as a member in 2006 and rose ranks to become the Secretary of Disability Affairs.[59]  During 2007 Kenya's General election, Mwaura was instrumental in mobilizing voters with disabilities and campaigning for the ODM presidential candidate Raila Odinga. After the 2007-2008 Kenyan crisis that resulted in the formation of Government of National Unity with Mwai Kibaki as a President and Raila Odinga as a Prime Minister,[citation needed] Mwaura was appointed as a Senior Adviser on Special Interest Groups in the Prime Minister's office and served from 2010 to 2012.",
          "In 2013, Mwaura was nominated by Orange Democratic Movement as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the Kenya's National Assembly to represent Special Interest Groups and he made history as the first Member of Parliament with albinism in Kenya.",
          "Mwaura thereafter joined Uhuru Kenyatta's presidential campaign team as one of the chief campaigners and a strategist. He was nominated as a Senator by Jubilee Party in 2017 to represent Persons with Disabilities in the Senate.[64]",
          "On 7 May 2021, the speaker of the Senate Kenneth Lusaka declared Mwaura's senatorial position vacant after an order from the Jubilee Party. Mwaura was accused of dealing with other parties other than the Jubilee Party that sponsored him to parliament.[67]"

Mwaura also pursued a Diploma in Public Relations Management from Kenya Institute of Management. In 2017, he was awarded with an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Humane Letters Honoris Causa) from UGCS - USA.[10]\n",
          "Despite recommendations from the neighbours for Mwaura to be trained to do menial tasks since he 'couldn't amount to much, anyway', Mwaura's mother disregarded the suggestion and instead enrolled him to Thika School for the Blind, a special national school that admitted pupils with visual impairment and albinism, so as he could get formal education.[19] This was after the school was recommended to the mother by a lady, Miss Margaret Teresia (MT) Waruinge, her first cousin, and who was a teacher in the school. Isaac joined the kindergarten in Thika School for the Blind at only four and half years old as a boarder. This was a torturous experience for such a young kid as such tender age in a boarding facility. Nevertheless, Mwaura had 28 classmates drawn from across the country such as Mushenik, Otieno, Abdi, Shematia and many others. This gave him a national outlook. It was also while in kindergarten that Mwaura become a class monitor at the age of five years, depicting leadership skills at an early age. In fact, at about six years, his maternal grandfather (a brother to his grandfather) would observe that due to Isaac's inquisitive nature, the boy would end up being a politician, something that his grandmother would refute. This was because both the grandmother Mary Wajiku and Isaac's mother used to work as casual labourers at the coffee farm of the local Member of Parliament then, Arthur Kinyanjui Magugu. Isaac did very well in class and due to his young age, he was not promoted to kindergarten Two, and therefore spent two years in kndergarten One. He averse that he cannot remember how he came to speak Kiswahili. Nevertheless, at six and half years he joined Standard One at Thika Primary School for the Blind. During his primary school years, he distinguished himself in athletics, poetry, solo verse, and was also a member of the Junior Choir as a soprano, Boy's Choir as a Tenor and also Mixed Choir. He also did well in Drama and won several awards. Interestingly, while in Standard Seven, he became the house captain for Kenyatta Sports House. Also, he was the Christian Union (CU) leader and a Sunday School teacher. While in Standard Eight, the teachers were of opinion he should be the Head Boy; However, it was opined that since he was a higher performer in class, he should be given double prefectship. He thus ended up being both a class prefect and a prefect of the general assembly. In that same year, Isaac emerged the top pupil in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in his school in 1996, and also the best in Kiswahili Public Speaking nationally.\n",
          "He won a slot in Starehe Boys' Centre, a prestigious and the top-performing school in Nairobi, but he was discriminated and denied admission. Mwaura proceeded to Thika High School for the Blind which he joined in 1997. While at high school, Mwaura became the school's head boy, an opportunity that enhanced his leadership skills.[20]\n",
          "After completing his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in 2000, Mwaura joined Kenyatta University in 2002 for a bachelor's degree in Special Education, French Studies and Japanese and completed in 2006. He further pursued and completed a Post-graduate diploma in Public Relations Management in Kenya Institute of Management and a Diploma in Theology in Presbyterian University of East Africa. Between 2010 and 2012, Mwaura enrolled and graduated with two master's degree: Master's Degree in Social and Public Policy as a Ford Scholar from University of Leeds in United Kingdom and Masters in Arts in Development Studies from Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in South Africa. In 2016, Mwaura was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Philosophy in Humanities (Honoris Causa) from UGCI- USA for his immeasurable contribution in serving the marginalized and minorities in Kenya.[21]\n",
          "Mwaura has worked in different organisations, both nationally and internationally. In 2004, while still a university student and aged 22 years, Mwaura was appointed as a board director to the National Council for the Persons with Disabilities, making him the first youngest board member in Kenya. After graduating from Kenyatta University in 2006, Mwaura worked as a Regional Programme Coordinator (Gender and Youth Development) with African Union of the Blind as well as a Programme Officer and Programme Manager with United Disabled People of Kenya and Kenya Society for the Blind respectively.  He then joined National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD) as the Head of Communications and Public Relations before rising to the position of deputy director of Programmes in the same state agency. He left the council in 2007 and joined Uraia Trust Civic Education Programme as a programme Officer in charge of the National Civic Education Programme. Mwaura joined Voluntary Services Overseas and worked as a Programme Development Advisor on Human Rights Based Approach in Papua New Guinea before jetting back to Kenya to work as a Senior Adviser on Special Interest Groups to the former Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga.[22][23]\n",
          "Mwaura was an activist as early as a freshman at Kenyatta University when he organised a strike against a Non-governmental organisation that was exploiting visually impaired students at the university. Subsequently, he and others successfully lobbied the Joint Admission Board of Kenya to admit students with special needs who had met the minimum required grade for university placement. While still a freshman at Kenyatta University, Mwaura was elected as a student leader and joined hands with other leaders including the current Homa Bay Women Representative Gladys Wanga to oust the then Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani out of office for he was serving an illegal term. During his tenure as a student leader, Mwaura is credited for coordinating the review of students' union constitution, transforming it from an archaic one to a more vibrant and inclusive document.[24]\n",
          "In 2006, Mwaura and other persons with albinism in Kenya founded Albinism Society of Kenya[usurped] (ASK), a national organisation that brings together persons with albinism in Kenya and whose mission is to create awareness on the rights of persons with albinism, their social inclusion, empowerment and equity to socio-economic opportunities. Mwaura articulated the objective of ASK: \"We wanted to share and celebrate our differences and uniqueness as persons with albinism and lobby the government to fund the national development fund for persons with albinism.\"[25] Mwaura is the National Coordinator and the Chairman of Albinism Society of Kenya, and through his stewardship, the organisation has made significant milestones in rescuing persons with albinism from ritual killings as well as creating job opportunities and economic empowerment for persons with albinism in Kenya. Additionally, the organisation has been involved in policy and legislative advocacy, albinism awareness, eye-care and sunscreen programme, education support, counselling programme and cancer treatment intervention for persons with albinism .[26] Through ASK, persons with albinism in Kenya are provided with free sunscreen lotions, prescription glasses and protective clothing in order to shield them from harmful solar radiation. Also to note, more than 30 hospitals in Kenya have been equipped with cryotherapy equipment in order to assist in mitigation of skin cancer, and a special fund has been set aside to meet medical expenses of skin patients with cancer with albinism. Other key achievements ASK is proud of is the appointment of Mumbi Ngugi, a woman with albinism, as the Judge of High Court in Kenya[27] and emergence of Goldalyn Kakuya, a girl with albinism, as the best student in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in Kenya in 2017 after scoring 455 marks out of 500.[28] Mwaura has mentored young persons with albinism, including Martin Pepela Wanyonyi, an elected Member of County Assembly (MCA) for Ndivisi Ward in Bungoma county, and Timothy Aseke who is a nominated MCA in Kakamega county.[29][30]\n",
          "Mwaura was born with Albinism, a genetic condition that causes the skin, hair and eyes to have little or no melanin pigment. Albinism is also associated with vision problems, and apparent lack of pigmentation makes persons with albinism susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers. Albinism is non-contagious condition that results from biological inheritance of genetically recessive alleles (genes) from both parents and it is characterised by the absence of tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in the production of melanin.[citation needed] Albinism is present within all ethnic groups and populations worldwide, but prevalence rates are particularly high in Africa.[45] Persons with albinism often face social and cultural challenges (including threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. In most African states, persons with albinism are socially stigmatised and less likely to complete schooling, find employment, and find partners.[46] The majority of people with albinism in East Africa live in marginalized social conditions and in a state of economic vulnerability because, apart from having a different physical appearance and having visual impairments, they cannot actively take part in agricultural work due to their sensitivity to the sun, and this effectively excludes them from engaging in the major productive activity in most rural areas.[47] In African countries such as Tanzania and Burundi, there has been unprecedented rise in witchcraft-related killings of people with albinism in recent years, because their bodies are used in portions sold by witch doctors. Another harmful and false belief is that having sexual intercourse with women with albinism can cure a man of HIV. This has led to rapes and subsequent HIV infection.[48]\n",
          "Mwaura in 2014 stated that persons with albinism in Kenya used the ambiguities in law to fight for recognition and their rights as citizens and pointed that the state ought to recognise threats to their lives as an infringement of their rights and grant them protection. Although Mwaura and Albinism Society of Kenya have successfully lobbied for a state-funded national sunscreen distribution programme for all registered persons with albinism in Kenya, the programme's current success and future sustenance seems dependent on the presentation of albinism as a disability, both in physiological as well as legal terms.[53] Pushing for the political recognition of people with albinism, both as individuals with a disability and at the same time as persons who should be fully included in society (through inclusive education and equal job market opportunities), is one of the positions that Mwaura and organisations such as Albinism Society of Kenya are carrying forward.[54]\n",
          "Mwaura's political career commenced in Kenyatta University where he was elected as a student leader in 2002 when he was a freshman. Through this position, he joined hands with other elected student leaders and lecturers to lobby the President Mwai Kibaki's Narc government to grant amnesty and readmit university students who had been expelled during the President Daniel arap Moi's regime. Subsequently, he and other leaders organised a major strike that ousted the Vice-Chancellor Professor George Eshiwani who was serving an illegal term at Kenyatta University.\n"
